            <p id= 1><b>Mahatma Gandhi</b>, also known as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day <strong>Gujarat, India.</strong></p>

                <p>Gandhi came from a middle-class Hindu family and received his early education in India. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule.

                Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.</p>
